Project Short Description: 
Getting a proper health care is still a luxury for a majority of the population for a developing country like Bangladesh and so we tried to solve that using a virtual assistant. We worked on Challenge 1: Virtual Assistant.

Project Detail:
We live in a country where the doctor-to-patient ratio is 5.26 per 10,000 people, the second-lowest in South Asia. If we look closely, we can find almost all the families of the middle class or lower middle class family have suffered due to lack of treatments from doctors. So, our goal is to improve the health care system of our country. The primary reason for our team being the best suited to build this solution is because one of our members lost two of his family members due to the lack of right treatment so our team knows how important, proper and timely treatment is and that explains our hunger for improving the health care system. Moreover, our team is enriched with coding expertises and our thirst for learning new technologies makes us unique. 
Our customers are all the medical centers and hospitals. We believe that our application will automate and increase the pace of the appointment system and hence will improve their business. Our users are the patients who are looking to avoid hassles of standing in a queue and waiting for months just to get appointed.
This problem is important because according to reports, negligence of doctors has cost 550 lives from 2012 to 2017, and the numbers are increasing. While these are mare numbers to others, but the ones who lose understand how hard it is. 
When a user sends a message to make an appointment to our bot, our bot asks what type of appointment(for eg, cardiac, medicine, orthopedics) does the user want. Then the bot prompts the user with some questions about the disease which the patient is suffering from and stores it in the database. The bot also asks for some personal information about the user for example name, contact details, age, gender, etc and they are stored in a database and forwarded to a doctor. Then, according to a free slot, an appointment is made for the patient and by the help of AWS SNS, a confirmation sms will be sent to the patient's mobile number. In this way, a patient is getting appointments in a hassle free manner, and also even before the patient visits the doctor, the doctor will have a basic idea about the patient and the complications which the patient is facing, thus allowing the patient to receive fast and better treatment.
